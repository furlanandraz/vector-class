# Vector class with applied vector operations
### Vector class in 2D with methods for vector operations
import Vector to your script
methods include
1.  scalar(num),
    num: int or float,
3.  addition(vector, 'str'),
    vector: adding vector,
    addition:'add', substraction: 'sub',
5.  dot(vector),
    vector: dot product vector,
6.  norm(decimal),
    decimal: int [0, ...],
7.  distance(point, decimal),
    point: second vector,
    decimal: int [0, ...],
8.  angle(vector, decimal),
    vector: second vector, if undefined equates to screen(1px, 1px),
    decimal: int [0, ...],

### Note the upside-down coordinate system when implementing!
